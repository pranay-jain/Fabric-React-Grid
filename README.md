# Fabric-React-Grid

A simple dynamic grid component made in Typescript and React. 
It uses the Microsoft Fabric React UI Components for setting up the responsive UI Elements. The Grid data elements are retrieved from a sample OData Server API and stored in the state. Redux is used for the state management of this app, while Sagas library is used for managing the middleware calls.

It's a simple, reusable component that can be easily expanded and also easily integrated into any existing project as a dynamic table-grid.
